A fair coin is flipped 100 times yielding a sequence a = (a1, . . . , a100) of Heads or Tails. Player
A realizes that if one thinks of Heads as +1 and Tails as −1, then for each k ∈ [1, 100],
$\text{S}_1(N) = \sum_{p=1}^N \text{E}(p)$
Furthermore P100
i=1 ai = 0. Player B thinks such a sequence is extremely unlikely and offers
a bet to A with a 100 : 1 odds that if they flip the coin again 100 times yielding a random
sequence x = (x1, . . . , x100), then x is not going to satisfy the properties of a. Should A
accept the bet? What are the true odds for such an event? Is there a good graphical
representation for the properties of a? What if there are 2n coin flips? Biased coin?
